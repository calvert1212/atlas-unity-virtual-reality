  <h3 align="left">Unity VR Showcase</h3>

My name is Chad Calvert and this is a showcase of various Unity VR projects I completed as part of my curriculum at 
Atlas School Tulsa. The projects demonstrate various fun functionalities of Unity VR, including 360 degree movie
theatre, object interactions, emotes, and avatar motion. These projects were challenging as I had to learn how to integrate VR hardware with the Unity engine, which required some problem solving despite the remarkable plug-and-play compatibility 
with Unity. These projects were tested with and designed for Meta Quest 2 headsets, compatibility for other headsets is 
untested. In the future I will add APK files for easy installation.

<h3 align="center">Installation and Building</h3>
For the time being, it is necessary to install Unity and build or test the projects by cloning the project files and 
then building them through Unity. Meta Quest 2 is highly recommended pending compatibility testing. Soon I will add APK 
files and update this section accordingly.

<h3 align="center">Challenges</h3>

My initial challenge with these projects was, frankly, spending far too long attempting to get the Meta Link 
functionality to work such that I could test the projects in-engine without having to compile them every time I wanted 
to test. I eventually discovered that my laptop is not capable of this functionality and that Meta Link was simply not 
working as opposed to giving me a message that Meta Link would not work on my hardware. I also had many challenges 
scripting different solutions regarding emote recognition.
